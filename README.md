# ngRoundProgressBar

An Angular directive that provides a nice round progress bar.


## How to User

You can check the `example.html` for a working setup. Basically, you just need to include the `main.js` and `main.css`
in the root directory and include `ngRoundProgressBar` as dependency. Then use as

```html
<div round-progress-bar="0.34"></div>
```
